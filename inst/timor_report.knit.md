# Fishing fleet and gear

## **The sampled fishing fleet**

## **Fishing gear**

(ref:IRIGearGroups) **Gear composition of the three regions using the Index of Relative Importance (IRI).** Gear composition using the Index of Relative Importance (IRI) of the landings of Atauro island, north coast, and south coast from April 2018 to December 2021. The IRI considers the weight and the number of fish caught per gear type, and the frequency of occurrence (FRQ) of a gear type.
